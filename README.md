Muse Bot is the chatbot component of a full-stack AI application designed to help beginner music producers streamline their learning process. It provides guidance on various aspects of music production, including beat-making, sound design, mixing, mastering, and arrangement.

Currently, I am integrating Muse Bot into the UI, so it is still a work in progress. Future improvements will include fine-tuning AI responses, expanding the chatbotâ€™s knowledge base, and adding functionality to save chat history between the user and the AI.

To run this locally, the user will have to create an .env file and add their open ai key as well as their astra database information
